- Custom recovery installed, such as TWRP.
- Basic knowledge of flashing custom kernels.

# Installation

To install the ThunderstormReborn-RM6785 kernel on your Realme 6785 device, follow these steps:

## Using FKM (Best procedure if you're rooted)

2. Open the app and give it superuser permissions.
3. On the bottom right corner, tap on the hamburger menu and tap on 'Flasher'
4. After you enter the Flasher, tap on install on 'Manual Flasher' at the bottom.
